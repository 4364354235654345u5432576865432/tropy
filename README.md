## Development

Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (at least the
version that ships with the current [Electron](https://electron.atom.io)
release) with [`node-gyp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp) and all
its requirements for your platform.

Then clone [this repository](https://github.com/tropy/tropy.git) and run
`npm install` to install all of Tropy's dependencies.

Run `npm test` to run all tests; `npm run test:renderer` or `npm run
test:browser` to run only the Renderer/Browser tests, or `node scripts/make
mocha -- <path>` to run only a given test file.

See `node scripts/make rules` and `node scripts/db rules` for additional
available targets.

Finally, to start [Tropy](https://tropy.org) in development mode, run `npm start`.
